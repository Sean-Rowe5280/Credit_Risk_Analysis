# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the purpose of this project is to build and train a machine learning models that will effectively predict credit risk based on a loans 76 features(interest rate, loan amount, credit limit, annual income, etc). The challenge with credit risk models is overcoming the unbalanced classification problem inherent with credit risk, i.e. low-risk/good loans outnumber high-risk loans. To account for this imbalance we used oversampling and undersampling are techniques and built 4 different models: (1) naive Random oversampling, (2) SMOTE oversampling, (3) ClusterCentroids undersampling, (5) SMOTEENN combination(over and under) sampling.
